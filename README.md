<h2>Playing Card Game</h2>
By Euxhen Hasanaj

Four players are handed out 10 cards each.
Each player chooses a card from their hand and  predicts  whether
they have the best card  among  all  four.  After each prediction
has been made, the cards are revealed and the winner is selected.

Score distribution is as follows

<table style="text-align:center;">
    <tr>
        <td>Pred</td>
        <td>Win?</td>
        <td>Updt</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>YES</td>
        <td>YES</td>
        <td>+1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>YES</td>
        <td>NO</td>
        <td>-1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
